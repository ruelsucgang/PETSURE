Fibonacci recursive / iterative:
 
It is easy to write a recursive program to compute the nth Fibonacci number and it is
partially defined by itself and consists of some simple case with a known answer. While the iterative 
is a loop based imperative repetitions of a process (in contrast to recursion which has a more declarative approach)

But I think, the recursive is a lot slower than the iterative. As much as possible, try not to use recursion in system critical locations.
If it is really required to implement the recursion, at least try to optiomize.
